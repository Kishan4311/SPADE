# SPADE-Speculative-Decoding-for-Precise-and-Low-Cost-Distributed-Edge-Cloud-Inference
SPADE's a distributed inference framework that integrates speculative decoding across edge and cloud. A compact draft model on edge generates candidate tokens; a large cloud verifier validates them in parallel. Accepted tokens are kept; only rejections invoke the verifier, cutting cloud queries and cost while preserving accuracyâ€”no retraining.
